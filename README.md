# 📈 Linear Regression from Scratch

Welcome to my Linear Regression from Scratch project! 🎉 I built this to roll up my sleeves and create a linear regression model in Python—no fancy machine learning libraries, just pure code and learning fun. 🚀

## 🛠️ Installation

Getting started was easy for me! I just installed the required packages with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage

When I want to see it in action, I run the script like this:

```
python your_script.py
```

👉 Don’t forget to replace `your_script.py` with the actual filename of the script you want to run!

## 🌟 Future Plans

I'm just getting started—here’s what I’m planning next:
- 🔢 Support for multiple linear regression
- 🛡️ Regularization techniques (to keep those models in check!)
- 📊 Even better data visualization tools

Stay tuned, and feel free to contribute or suggest ideas! Happy coding! 😄
